# Ciphersaber for the Commander x16.

Really, the goal is just levelling up my assembler chops on the commander x16.
But, I do want it to be usable/convenient as a library.

So. Maybe I'll have a main.asm that will be the driver, and a
ciphersaber.asm that the main.asm ".include"'s?

Tho, it'd be cool to be able to do something like:

    10 va$ = "whatever"

and _somehow_ be able to call ciphersaber on that value. Perhaps a stretch goal for later.
